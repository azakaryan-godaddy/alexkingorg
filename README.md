Alex King's Site, all in flat files.

A few weeks before Alex passed we spoke about ways to archive his site so it could stay up, regardless of WordPress or hosting. A task he said he wanted to explore with some code. When we last spoke he did not get a chance to work in it so I do not think it was archived by him. However some folks in the Post Status slack channel told me about a program to scrape and save the site.. this is it. Voila.
