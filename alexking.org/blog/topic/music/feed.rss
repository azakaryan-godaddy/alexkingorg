<p>This morning I saw <a href="http://twitter.com/justin/status/592686821097775104">Justin&#8217;s tweet about Toad the Wet Sprocket</a> which led me to their Wikipedia to confirm that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad_the_Wet_Sprocket#Name_origin">they took their name from a Monty Python sketch</a>. Along the way, I saw that they just released a <a href="http://toadthewetsprocket.com/new-constellation-out-now/">new album</a>. <em>California Wasted</em> stands out to me on my initial listen through.</p>
<p>I went to Amazon to buy the MP3 album and was quite surprised to find that it was available free as part of Amazon Prime Music. You&#8217;ve all got Prime, right? Go grab your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Constellation-Toad-Wet-Sprocket/dp/B00ELE8EW2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1381829234&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=toad+the+wet+sprocket">free copy</a>.</p>
<p>They are <a href="http://toadthewetsprocket.com/on-tour/">touring</a> too. I saw them perform at <a href="https://www.chautauqua.com/">Chautauqua</a> a few years ago and they did a great show.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to get some headphones to keep at the office for a while. About a month ago I started doing some research, inspired by Amazon&#8217;s Black Friday deals and watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XD2kNopsUs" rel="external">Jason Fried&#8217;s TEDx talk about interruptions</a>. Here is what I&#8217;ve gleaned so far.</p>
<p>There are three basic kinds of headphone designs that are currently popular:</p>
<ol>
<li>In-ear &#8211; the little earbud design that you insert into your ear. These typically provide noise isolation.</li>
<li>Open air &#8211; an over the head design with big ear cups that are open to let sound escape and create a more natural sound. These are considered to deliver the best overall sound quality.</li>
<li>Closed &#8211; an over the head design with big ear cups that keeps sound in. Also referred to as &#8220;monitor&#8221; style headphones. These often include noise isolation or active noise reduction (for travel on airplanes, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ve read a bunch of reviews and gotten a series of recommendations regarding specific models. I&#8217;ve always been pleased with Sennheisers and they seem to be well regarded; Grados seems to be universally considered even better for open air headphones. I&#8217;ve also had recommendations for Shure and Bowsers &#038; Wilkins for closed options. These aren&#8217;t cheap, but they seem to be a reasonable balance between budget cans and the ultra-expensive models. I expect to get a few years out of them.</p>
<p>For use at the office, with our open floorplan, it seems that open air style headphones are probably not appropriate. They, by design, allow sound to leak out which means people nearby can also hear what you&#8217;re listening to. I don&#8217;t really like the in-ear design due to comfort preference and concern over durability.</p>
<p>This is the first time in ages that I&#8217;ve done research in detail like this for something to buy and to be honest, I got fatigued by it. I guess I don&#8217;t enjoy this type of immersive shopping as much as I used to.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I ended up getting the <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/headphones/srh840-professional-monitoring-headphones" rel="external">Shure SRH840</a>s<sup><a href="#fn1292828736786n" id="fn1292828736786" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and I&#8217;ve been pleased with them. They are balanced, monitor-style headphones &#8211; you get a sound true to the original recording (if you want heavy bass, look elsewhere). From what I&#8217;ve read, they should sound even better once I get more hours logged on them and they &#8220;break in&#8221; a bit more. Initial feedback from the rest of the team on them has been positive as well.</p>
<ol class="footnotes">
<li id="fn1292828736786n">Actually, I got them for the whole <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">team</a>. We will be in temporary office space in early 2011 while our office is remodeled, so this will help give everyone a quiet work environment no matter where we end up during that time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My cousin Ryan is crashing with us tonight on his way back to grad school in Ohio. Much like <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/09/played-it-til-my-fingers-bled">last time</a>, we had a great time staying up too late diddling around on a couple of guitars. Also much like last time, I discovered I have zero calluses on my fretting hand these days.</p>
<p>I should really start trying to find time to play more often.</p>
<p>My tip for any acoustic guitarists out there, try the <a href="http://www.jimdunlop.com/index.php?page=products/pip&#038;id=1&#038;pmh=products/picks" rel="external">Jim Dunlop Nylon Standard picks</a>. I prefer the .88mm &#8211; soft enough to mute the pick/string click you get with hard plastic picks but still stiff enough to pick with. If you&#8217;re mainly playing rhythm, the .73&#8217;s are worth trying out as well. For electric, I like the <a href="http://www.jimdunlop.com/index.php?page=products/pip&#038;id=16&#038;pmh=products/picks" rel="external">Tortex Black Gold Standard</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> NBC has <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2006/12/09/kudos-to-nbc">now made this song available for download</a>. Here is a <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip/music/studio_60_o_holy_night.mp3" rel="external">direct link</a>.</p>
<p>The jazz version of O Holy Night at the end of tonight&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip/" rel="external">Studio 60</a> knocked my socks off. When the voiceover said to go to nbc.com for more on tonight&#8217;s music, I was very hopeful. I thought, &#8220;perhaps they really are getting it!&#8221; After all, they are offering video of the episodes over the web now &#8211; maybe there will be an MP3 version of the song to download or purchase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all this hope turned to utter disappointment when I arrived at nbc.com, poked around for a while, and found only <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip/music/" rel="external">this</a>:</p>
<p class="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/314738129/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/95/314738129_27cf781bc1_m.jpg" width="227" height="240" alt="Music from Studio 60" /></a></p>
<p>A listing of the musicians and a pointer to a web site to support the rebuilding of music in New Orleans. Sure I think this is a good cause, but I was really hoping to get myself a copy of that O Holy Night performance.</p>
<p>If you missed the show, you&#8217;ll be able to <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Video/rewind/full_episodes/?show=studio60" rel="external">see it online</a> in a couple of hours. Jump to the end to watch and listen to the musical performance &#8211; it&#8217;s breathtaking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been enjoying watching Studio 60 this season. It isn&#8217;t as good as the West Wing, but I really enjoy Sorkin&#8217;s writing. And <a href="http://dsandler.org/erinmak/diary/2006/11/08/you-need-to-be-watching-studio-60/" rel="external">I&#8217;m not the only one</a> &#8211; love this quote (emphasized below).</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorkin is at his best when dealing with conflict, and this episode takes on conflict. Itâ€™s not the explosive kind of conflict that is the result of the John-Wellsification of NBC TV, but the strive to explore both sides conflict that TWW thrived on. John Goodmanâ€™s character delights in thwarting the Hollywood suitsâ€™ expectations of him by messing with their heads, and Sorkin delights in showing it to us. Matt at one point sums up the culture wars by saying that <em>&#8220;Your side hates my side because you think we think youâ€™re stupid, and my side hates your side because we think youâ€™re stupid.&#8221;</em> These kinds of semi-in-depth looks at the culture wars could be the bread and butter of Studio 60.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s just on a different level then the rest of what I see on TV.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The let down continues:</p>
<p class="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/315099200/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/108/315099200_8617a9c43d_m.jpg" width="226" height="240" alt="Video Not Found" /></a></p>
<p>UPDATE #2: Here is a <a href="http://video.nbc.com/player.html?dlid=48861" rel="external">direct link to the musical performance</a>. Just beautiful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2006/07/09/vienna-teng/">As planned</a>, I went to <a href="http://viennateng.com/" rel="external">Vienna Teng</a>&#8216;s concert at the <a href="http://www.thewalnutroom.com/" rel="external">Walnut Room</a><sup><a href="#fn1154584218051n" id="fn1154584218051" class="footnote">1</a></sup> this evening.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen Vienna perform a few times in <a href="http://www.echeng.com/journal/index.php?p=10&#038;more=1&#038;c=1" rel="external">smaller venues</a>, but not since I&#8217;d moved to Denver from the Bay Area in 2004.</p>
<p>As you would expect, her performance skills have matured quite a bit after spending the last few years on the road. She seems completely confident and at ease on stage, and her voice is strong and true.</p>
<p>She played a lot of the tunes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FZESVM/" rel="external">her new CD</a>, which definitely has a different feel than her earlier albums. Adam has a nice <a href="http://www.tow.com/2006/08/01/dreaming-through-the-noise/" rel="external">write-up about the album</a> on his blog.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen her perform live and you enjoy her music, you really need to make sure you catch this tour.</p>
<p>Besides the great show, it was a treat to see <a href="http://www.balanceinmotion.net/blog/" rel="external">Eric</a><sup><a href="#fn1154583058043n" id="fn1154583058043" class="footnote">2</a></sup> again as well. Eric had the forethought to bring his camera, so perhaps we&#8217;ll get some photos from the show on Flickr or his blog. Also, great job on the <a href="http://viennateng.com/scrapbook/?p=50" rel="external">new site</a> Eric!</p>
<ol class="footnotes">
<li id="fn1154584218051n">Nice venue, the French Dip sandwich was tasty as well. [<a href="#fn1154584218051">back</a>]</li>
