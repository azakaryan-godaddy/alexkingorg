<p>Thankfully there is a voice of sanity among Texas Republicans:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your letter pandering to idiots &#8230; has left me livid,&#8221; former State Rep. Todd Smith wrote Gov. Abbott. &#8220;I am horrified that I have to choose between the possibility that my Governor actually believes this stuff and the possibility that my Governor doesn&#8217;t have the backbone to stand up to those who do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great piece by David Frum (a speechwriter in the George W. Bush administration) for New York Magazine. I&#8217;ve pulled a few quotes below, but it&#8217;s definitely worth reading the whole thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the face of evidence of dwindling upward mobility and long-stagnating middle-class wages, my party&#8217;s economic ideas sometimes seem to have shrunk to just one: more tax cuts for the very highest earners.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But the thought leaders on talk radio and Fox do more than shape opinion. Backed by their own wing of the book-publishing industry and supported by think tanks that increasingly function as public-relations agencies, conservatives have built a whole alternative knowledge system, with its own facts, its own history, its own laws of economics.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I refuse to believe that I am the only Republican who feels this way. If CNN&#8217;s most recent polling is correct, only half of us sympathize with the tea party. However, moderate-minded people dislike conflictâ€”and thus tend to lose to people who relish conflict.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The conservative shift to ever more extreme, ever more fantasy-based ideology has ominous real-world consequences for American society. The American system of government can&#8217;t work if the two sides wage all-out war upon each other: House, Senate, president, each has the power to thwart the others. In prior generations, the system evolved norms and habits to prevent this kind of stonewalling. For example: Theoretically, the party that holds the Senate could refuse to confirm any Cabinet nominees of a president of the other party. Yet until recently, this just &#8220;wasn&#8217;t done.&#8221; In fact, quite a lot of things that theoretically could be done just &#8220;weren&#8217;t done.&#8221; Now old inhibitions have given way. Things that weren&#8217;t done suddenly are done.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I got an e-mail from the producer of <a href="http://bushism.net/" rel="external">Bushisms</a> offering me a chance to review the new Bushisms DVD, a big grin spread across my face. Regardless of your politics, our current President has certainly had some funny moments at the microphone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d only glanced through the Bushism books previously so I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what to expect. There is definitely a risk of something like this having a nasty edge, but I thought the Bushisms DVD did a very good job of poking fun at the jumbled words without going after the man directly (at least not viciously).</p>
<p>Many of the quotes are somewhat famous at this point, but listening to them all back to back is quite a ride. For me, it started out funny, then got a little embarrasing, then downright painful.</p>
<p>The George W. Bush singers are definitely a highlight. You can see them in action in the <a href="http://bushism.net/trailers.html" rel="external">demo video clip</a>. Their rendition of 4000 years is (unfortunately) very catchy and was stuck in my head for a day or two.</p>
<p>It was also interesting to hear from the people that help bring attention to these gaffes. Jacob Weisberg of <a href="http://slate.com/" rel="external">Slate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;after September 11th. We went through a lot of agonizing about whether with the nation at war and under attack, if it was right to continue making fun of the President. And when he said that, we realized we had no choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>One silly thing that struck me; during parts of the DVD when you are reading from the screen (with little or no audio), there is background music playing that is reminiscent of original Nintendo games. I wonder if anyone else had the same thought when they heard it. <img src="http://alexking.org/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Anyway, if you like watching verbal train wrecks, Bushisms on DVD is a must-see.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So to follow up on <a href="http://www.bitweever.org/" rel="external">Greg</a>&#8216;s <a href="index.php?p=163#c111">comments</a> regarding my stance on the war. I guess I&#8217;m somewhere on the fence. My problem with our country&#8217;s actions is not so much that we are going after Saddam Hussein, but the way we&#8217;ve done it with little regard for the UN or world opinion and what I consider a campaign of deception here in the US. The polls I&#8217;ve seen show between 55% and 75% support for the invasion and 35%-45% asked in the same poll thought that we had evidence that Iraq had ties to 9/11. At this point, I&#8217;m just hoping that we are willing to work with the UN and other countries after Saddam is gone and repair some of the international goodwill we have burned in the last few months. <span id="more-171"></span></p>
<p>Here is an article about <a href="http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/23/do2305.xml&#038;sSheet=/opinion/2003/03/23/ixop.html" rel="external">Iraqi&#8217;s in favor of the the US invasion</a> written by a Jewish-American living in London who had actaully gone to Baghdad to protest the war.</p>
<p>Contrast that to reports I heard on BBC radio of Iraqis who were returning to Iraq through Jordan. These men were returning to fight against the British and US troops. I think that the only thing that is clear is that there is no 100% consensus how the Iraqi people feel about the war, like everything else in the Middle East &#8211; it&#8217;s complicated.</p>
<p>There is some good reading to be had over <a href="http://www.enjelani.net/archives/00000265.htm" rel="external">here</a>, don&#8217;t forget to read the comments too.</p>

I couldn&#8217;t remember the location of the station, so I was scanning up the dial and ran across a station playing rap &#8211; I liked the beat so I listened to that instead on the way to work.</p>
<p>I did manage to do a little reading this evening though, here are some links:</p>
<p>California Representative Henry Waxman has posted a <a href="http://www.house.gov/waxman/text/admin_iraq_march_17_let.htm" rel="external">letter to the President</a>. (Thanks Jim)</p>
<p>I think all Americans should read <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0318-01.htm" rel="external">this article</a>. <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/03/24/kutler/index.html" rel="external">This article</a> from Salon pointed me to it. Are we still a country that values dialogue and the dissenting point of view?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m having trouble with the &quot;Now that the war has started, we should support the troops&quot; attitude. I don&#8217;t hold the soliders accountable personally for the invasion, I understand the soliders role and place the blame squarely on our leaders for the direction we are taking. I don&#8217;t want the soldiers to be hurt or killed and I don&#8217;t look at them as murderers or anything like that &#8211; but I can&#8217;t support what they are doing.</p>
<p>I think there is a bit of a logical problem with &quot;supporting the troops but opposing the war&quot;. If you oppose the war, then you oppose the invasion. If you oppose the invasion, you oppose the actions of the troops that are doing the invading. So if you say you oppose the war and that means you oppose the actions of the troops, what does it mean to say that you oppose the war but support the troops. What does it mean to &quot;support&quot; the troops and oppose their actions at the same time? <span id="more-160"></span></p>
<p>Here is an article <a href="http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20030320.html" rel="external">debunking some myths</a> on both sides of the war discussion.</p>
<p>Robert Elliott has <a href="http://robertelliott.org/iraq/bush-17mar.php4" rel="external">dissected the President&#8217;s speech</a>. Has anyone else noticed that the President breaks down sentances into 2-3 word chunks and delivers them very slowly without normal sentance inflection. I think this is a change his speech team made intentionally so he doesn&#8217;t make inflection mistakes while giving the speech as he did during the election campaign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Moore has an <a href="http://michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2003-03-17" rel="external">open letter to the president</a> that is a worthy read. I&#8217;m still not sure why we are going to go invade Iraq.</p>
<p>[Note, war just started.]</p>
<p>Aaron Swartz has <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000868" rel="external">some good words</a>.</p>
<p>Bill has also been blogging about the <a href="http://www.bcmanning.com/b2/index.php?p=51&#038;c=1" rel="external">oil-war</a>.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with Enjelani&#8217;s <a href="http://www.enjelani.net/archives/00000262.htm" rel="external">fence straddling</a>. I want to believe there is <i>some</i> reason we are doing this.</p>
<p>MPT has also <a href="http://mpt.phrasewise.com/2003/03/20#a485" rel="external">chimed in</a> with some good thoughts.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.tampatantrum.com/leftovers/003025.html" rel="external">good words about patriotism</a> from former President Theodore Roosevelt, thanks Robyn.</p>
<p>From the BBC, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/2773213.stm" rel="external">steps to war</a>.</p>
<p>From the words of the President this evening:<br />
<blockquote>We have no ambition in Iraq, except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people.</p></blockquote>
<p> What exactly is the threat and when did the people of Iraq ask us to come bomb them? I wonder how we would feel if another country told us to disarm. We&#8217;d probably tell them to piss off too. I feel really sad about my country today&#8230;</p>
