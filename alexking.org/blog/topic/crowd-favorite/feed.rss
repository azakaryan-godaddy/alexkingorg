				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in September I went on <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2014/10/27/on-medical-leave">medical leave</a> at Crowd Favorite. That ended on March 15th and due to a number of reasons, I&#8217;m not going to be re-joining the team in my previous capacity. Instead, I will be an advisor to Crowd Favorite while I return to my independent developer roots.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The largest factor in this decision was a desire to have complete control over what I&#8217;m putting my effort into. If you&#8217;re thinking that this kind of selfishness can be poisonous in a team atmosphere, I would agree with you whole-heartedly. Dealing with cancer has been a sharpener for me. I am more careful than ever about how I spend my time, and that doesn&#8217;t fit well into a team dynamic. No matter how great the team is.</p>
<p><a href="http://monarchyllc.com/"><img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/monarchy-logo-510x266.png" alt="monarchy-logo" width="480" height="250" class="alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-21440" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://monarchyllc.com/" title="Independent PHP development and consulting.">Monarchy</a></strong> is my new one-man shop. I am offering consulting, development, and UX design services. I&#8217;m only interested in touching enterprise-scale projects as a consultant or to fill a specific role.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I will also be working on some pet projects that have been relegated to the back burner over the years.</p>
<p>While I love the team I helped build at Crowd Favorite and I look forward to their continued success, I&#8217;m also looking forward to transitioning away from the management and leadership role I had there and spending my time on the actual  <img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/themes/alexking.org-v3/smilies/ak_scare1.gif" alt=":scare:" class="wp-smiley" />  hands-on  <img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/themes/alexking.org-v3/smilies/ak_scare2.gif" alt=":/scare:" class="wp-smiley" />  work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve got a ton of great stuff going on at <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/">Crowd Favorite</a> right now. We are <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/04/hiring-web-developers/">hiring for front and back end web developers</a>, and we just put out a call for <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/05/hiring-jr-developers/">junior developers</a>.</p>
<p>While our first preference is to continue expanding our offices in Denver, Los Angeles (and Orange County), Las Vegas and Bucharest, we&#8217;re also considering remote candidates. The exception is for the junior developer position, we&#8217;re only considering candidates at our offices for that position so that we can more easily provide support and mentorship.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> We have a great developer-centric culture that embraces learning, sharing and best practices &#8211; come join us!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also updated our <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/05/ramp-v1-5-3/">RAMP</a> and <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/05/carrington-build-v1-3-3/">Carrington Build</a> WordPress products this week. RAMP handles selectively pushing content from your staging to your production environment while Carrington Build provides drag-and-drop editorial control for your high value pages.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking all this activity explains the lack of recent blog posts here, I won&#8217;t argue with that conclusion. <img src="http://alexking.org/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> we&#8217;re getting ready to hire several developers. I&#8217;ve been told that our on-boarding process can be stressful, but I&#8217;ve also been told that this is the case for most high performing teams. I&#8217;d like to smooth the path a little for our new hires, so I&#8217;m going to try a new approach.</p>
<p>Early on in the interview process I&#8217;m going to try to put a voice to things that are too often assumed and not explicitly discussed often enough. Specifically, that <em>each new hire will have two additional jobs</em> that come along with the job they are being hired for.</p>
<h3>Job #1: Learn everything about how the team does things and why.</h3>
<p>This means combing through the intranet and reading about historical decisions, talking to your colleagues and asking a bunch of questions (some of which may feel &#8220;dumb&#8221;), and learning everything you can about current processes. It means keeping an open mind, even when things seem silly, and asking questions about those situations.</p>
<p>It means learning which team member is the &#8220;go to&#8221; for various things, learning differing communication styles and systems, and figuring out how to be efficient within a new toolset. This can take 3-6 months; if you&#8217;re in month 9 and still struggling, that&#8217;s a concern and you need to talk to someone about it.</p>
<h3>Job #2: Contribute by doing what you were hired to do.</h3>
<p>This is the easiest bit &#8211; it&#8217;s the straightforward part of the gig. Here&#8217;s a project, help us build it. Along the way, make sure you&#8217;re learning and leveraging your knowledge of how the team works so that you make the jobs of the people around you easier. This means having empathy for the people whose work collides with your own; and reaching out to them in a helpful way in the areas where your work meets.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be asked to do this from day one, but you&#8217;ll struggle with it at first. It should become easier as you work through Job #1.</p>
<h3>Job #3: Redefine your job based on your experience and unique perspective.</h3>
<p>Once you know how the team works and you&#8217;re confident doing your job and supporting those around you, it&#8217;s time to take the next step. This might take 6 months, or it might take 2 years, but you should aspire to take your knowledge and experience and improve the way your job is executed.</p>
<p>This may mean proposing new processes, spearheading new training programs in areas that were important but neglected, creating new documentation and resources for important but occasionally accessed information, and working with your colleagues to understand how you can better support them.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, how can you make your role and yourself more valuable to team? What this means will be largely up to you.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what we want &#8211; each team member contributing to do their job and improve the team. We want every team member to succeed, which means we need them to succeed three jobs. We&#8217;ll see if this helps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently got an email that asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you ever question whether WordPress is the correct CMS for something?</p>
<p>I am a big WordPress fan too and I&#8217;ve solved some really cool content management challenges with it but there are times when I think, this site would probably be faster and more efficient if it were built using some MVC framework?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>With small business sites, this isn&#8217;t really that big a deal but with some of the enterprise-level clients you work with I wonder whether it becomes an issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than replying via email, I thought this might be a good topic for a blog post.</p>
<p>First off, I should mention that when clients come to <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a>, it is often because they have already made a technology choice to use WordPress and have found us because of our reputation in working with WordPress. That said, we believe in using the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Most often that tool is WordPress, but there are times when we suggest alternative solutions that are a better fit for their specific problem. We&#8217;ve used our Oxygen MVC platform for a number of client projects, sometimes in conjunction with a WordPress powered site.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits to using WordPress vs. a custom solution is that scaling WordPress is generally a solved problem. There are lots of smart folks who have figured this out and shared their knowledge within the community. We are very comfortable deploying high traffic sites on WordPress.</p>
<p>Scaling a custom application is often a journey of discovery. Sometimes this journey can be a bit rocky, and lonely. You will need to solve most of your problems on your own. This makes WordPress a safer choice when all other things are equal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on record saying I don&#8217;t believe WordPress is a good general application platform, but I think it&#8217;s wonderful for certain types of apps. Our developer journal, <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/">Capsule</a> is a great example of this. We created a distributed journal app that can sync back to a central server/hub &#8211; all on WordPress. I&#8217;ve also created an HR logging system using WordPress. These have worked quite nicely.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I believe in a pragmatic approach. The things that go into this decision include:</p>
<ul>
<li>comparing site needs to what WordPress does out of the box</li>
<li>consider known and projected future enhancements</li>
<li>consider potential scaling concerns</li>
<li>consider the importance of the community and lack of vendor lock-in to the client</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, that means we choose WordPress much of the time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday Karim and I signed the final papers to <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/02/velomedia-and-crowd-favorite-join-forces/">bring my Crowd Favorite team together with his VeloMedia team</a>. Whew!</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;ve told the story of how I came to build Crowd Favorite countless times. I tell it on podcasts and in on-stage interviews, to candidates during the recruitment and interview process, to folks who are just starting out creating their businesses &#8211; it&#8217;s a leading plot line in the story of the last decade of my life.</p>
<p>I spent 5 years working at startups in the Bay Area during the first boom and bust. One startup succeeded, the other fizzled. During that time I saw many companies rise and fall, I saw acquisitions and exits, mergers and failures. I grew weary of the attitude that was so pervasive in the Bay Area; one that focused so much on raising capital and building towards an exit. I wanted to actually build stuff; not create perceived value to capitalize on.</p>
<p>At the end of 2003 my wife and I decided to leave the Bay Area. We chose Denver, sold our townhouse, and moved.</p>
<p>Instead of looking for a new job in the Denver area, I decided to go independent and start building software of my own. This also afforded me the opportunity to be active in the fledgling WordPress community.</p>
<p>By 2007, WordPress had matured to the point that a demand for professional services was growing. I did a few WordPress gigs and started to see demand for more than I could provide as an individual. I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on some of the cool projects I was seeing, so I decided to try <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2007/05/21/introducing-eric-miller">bringing on another developer to help</a>. By the end of the year we had expanded to a team of 4. Over the next 6 years we grew, slowly and intentionally, to a team of 15.</p>
<hr />
<p>While working with my team, we figured stuff out and expanded our capabilities. I had no formal training in business or management, and we did a lot of experimenting and learning on the fly. Often things worked out well, sometimes we learned lessons the hard way. But we were careful to take away something of value from each experience.</p>
<p>I had been active within the WordPress community and various other &#8220;birds of a feather&#8221; developer-centric communities and events for years, but I had rarely<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> engaged with other digital agency owners in the same capacity.</p>
<p>I believe Crowd Favorite was the first WordPress-focused agency. This has had many benefits, but also a few drawbacks. Having been established a couple of years ahead of most shops in the WordPress community, we were trailblazing on our own. When sharing stories with other shops in the WordPress community, the topics would frequently be things my team and I had already solved or moved past. As it turns out, this was extremely limiting.</p>
<p>Last summer I had the opportunity to go to <a href="http://ownercamp.com/">OwnerCamp</a> and it was a revelation.</p>
<p>OwnerCamp opened my eyes to the greater digital agency landscape. 6+ years may have been old within the WordPress community, but here I was meeting folks who had been running shops for 10-15 years. In the course of a few days, my understanding of what Crowd Favorite could become exploded.</p>
<p>I saw how much I still had to learn, and I had a few key takeaways from that experience and the few weeks of thinking that followed.</p>
<ol>
<li>With my previously limited vision, I felt that we were close to being established and complete. We had chosen to settle into a comfortable space and were refining things rather than taking next steps. I could now see a map for the future of Crowd Favorite that showed us not even at the halfway point.</li>
<li>I recognized that taking these next steps would require moving the company beyond my own limitations. We were good at taking on a new challenge, figuring it out as we went, then learning from the experience and refining the process but I wasn&#8217;t sure that was the right way to move ahead at this point. I&#8217;ll come back to this below.</li>
<li>Most of the other agencies I met operated as a partnership. It can be lonely at the top regardless of the size of the hill. It also showed me that there other shops doing interesting work and being just as thoughtful about how they went about it as we were.</li>
</ol>
<p>Armed with a new perspective, I had some choices to make.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like most shops in the WordPress community (and many of the shops I met at OwnerCamp), Crowd Favorite evolved into a business based on individual reputation and subsequent team execution. We were designers and developers solving problems, and we were very good at that part of the job.</p>
<p>But it turns out there are other parts of the job. Larger clients and organizations have certain expectations about how your team will interact with them. Account and client management, training and on-going support, documentation and final delivery packaging; all of these things require expertise and attention if you want to do them well. And then there are the internal challenges. Making sure employees are happy, challenged and can see a future for themselves within your organization. And of course, watching the bottom line.</p>
<p>When Karim and I started talking in earnest last fall it was quickly apparent that we were building towards the same goal, but from opposite and complimentary perspectives. We shared the same values and ideals of building something sustainable and focusing on employee and team health and success, and we were creating teams that championed our own strengths. Crowd Favorite was mature on the technical side, while VeloMedia could deliver to top tier clients on the business side. The opportunity to bring the teams together was easy and obvious.</p>
<p>I could see where I wanted Crowd Favorite to go, and the things we needed to learn and improve were the same things VeloMedia was already doing well. Sure, we could take a few years to learn these lessons on our own. I knew we could do it, but we&#8217;d certainly have hiccups along the way (and occasionally a client would suffer because of them). Also, I knew this area was not my strength. Would I be able to effectively lead the team through this process?</p>
<p>The alternative was much more appealing. Come together with an established and successful business-side team and jump ahead of that process by a few years. This is what we chose to do. It also has a pleasant side-effect of allowing me to focus on the stuff that I&#8217;m most excited about; I&#8217;m stepping into the CTO role.</p>
<p>I ask each person on my team think critically, bring new ideas to the table, and always strive to improve our approach, process and execution. As we bring the companies together, we are doing exactly that. Things are changing and evolving. Some things that have been easy will be harder for a while as we work through them. Some things that were a struggle are suddenly easier. We&#8217;re on a great path, and I can&#8217;t wait to see where we are in a few months.</p>
<p>I created Crowd Favorite out of a desire to build something of lasting value. That hasn&#8217;t changed. My decision to sell the business to VeloMedia is not about an  <img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/themes/alexking.org-v3/smilies/ak_scare1.gif" alt=":scare:" class="wp-smiley" />  exit  <img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/themes/alexking.org-v3/smilies/ak_scare2.gif" alt=":/scare:" class="wp-smiley" /> , it&#8217;s about taking the next step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve pushed out a few new versions of RAMP recently, addressing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/01/ramp-v1-4-4/">v1.4.4</a> More obvious error messages when media fails to transfer</li>
<li><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/01/ramp-v1-4-3/">v1.4.3</a> and <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/01/ramp-v1-4-2/">v1.4.2</a> both address issues with backslashes being removed from content. I&#8217;ve written about <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/thread/wordpress-slashes">this issue</a> ad nauseum, but RAMP was originally written before the issue was discovered. If my patches had gone through, RAMP would have been silently fixed. Instead, we needed to patch it to match the insane WordPress core behavior (adding slashes to things before saving them).</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway &#8211; a few nice recent changes to make RAMP better! We&#8217;ve also added additional customer documentation around troubleshooting various issues, something we intend to continue to expand.</p>
