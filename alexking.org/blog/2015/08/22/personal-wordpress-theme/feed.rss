		<description><![CDATA[Excellent, its time for an update to Personal from Favepersonal. By the way, all my custom mods work well. Also when I install Social as suggested I get the white screen of death and I have to go through PHPmyadmin and update the appropriate DB fields and revert back to i.e.. the default theme and then delete Social via FTP and then Personal is back to normal.

I also tried to install a previous stable version of Social, the one Favepersonal 1.5 came bundled with and Personal stills give the white screen of death. Perhaps, I&#039;m missing something silly, more than likely, but I thought I&#039;d pass it on to you since I couldn&#039;t figure out how to leave the comment on github. Cheers and thanks for the fork.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Boy, you really gave up easy in that review. The idea of a review is to both give and take. 

The reviewer is not wrong about the meta boxes, because when releasing a theme to others, making things compatible is important too.

The colors thing fits the nature of a theme, certainly, but the objection there is to the specific plugin code you used, not the specific idea behind it.

Maybe you could take reviews as legitimate criticism and then consider the other side of the fence as well. Just a thought.]]></description>
