		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree.  When you&#039;re sitting there waiting for a session to start, turn to the person to your left, introduce yourself and ask how they use WordPress (or what brings them here, or anything else). Then repeat with the person on your right. And in front of you and behind you. And for goodness sakes, exchange business cards!
Just about everybody is there to network, and you never know who might be sitting next to you. 

You know what I think would be nice?  A lower sponsor level... maybe a &#039;shout out&#039; sponsor level where you pay between $30 and $100 just to have your name posted somewhere (maybe on a whiteboard) at the WordCamp.  I&#039;d do that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I couldn&#039;t agree more. In most cases, all of the sessions are recorded and can be seen online later anyway. Spending time conversing with the attendees, speakers, sponsors and organizers, that&#039;s the true value of attending WordCamp.]]></description>
