	<div class="entry-content">
<p>Back at the end of November <a href="../../11/28/logitech-s-530-bad-first-impression.html">my desktop machine froze</a> and my <a href="../../11/28/monkeywrench.html">hard drives got corrupted</a>. It happens. I hadn’t done a recent backup (entirely my fault), so I had a choice: forget about the data I was losing or pay someone to get it back for me. I decided on the latter. So far, it has not worked out well.</p>
<p>First I took the drives to Eboxlab<sup><a href="reynolds-data-recovery-nightmare.html#fn1166603705385n" id="fn1166603705385" class="footnote">1</a></sup> but that didn’t work out so well. Then I <a href="../02/hard-drive-update.html">choose to take the drives</a> up to <a href="http://data-recovery.com" rel="external">Reynolds Data Recovery</a>.</p>
<p>When I took my drives up to them, I’d had nothing but good experiences with Reynolds. I met a fellow from there at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampDenverAttendees" rel="external">BarCampDenver</a>, and every time I’d called (getting information), my call was quickly answered and the person on the other end of the phone knew what they were talking about.</p>
<p>They gave me estimates I was comfortable with ($600-1400 and 3-5 days), so I drove up there and dropped off my drives along with an additional external drive for them to put the recovered data on. Since then, things have not gone smoothly.</p>
<p>Here is a timeline:</p>
<ul id="reynolds_timeline">
<li>Tue, Nov 28 – Call Reynolds for information. I am told a recovery like this will take 3-5 days.</li>
<li>Fri, Dec 1 – Drop off hard drives for recovery.</li>
<li>Tue, Dec 5 – Receive call from Mark, confirm $800 price (which they have already charged to my credit card) and that drives will be ready to pick up Friday (8th) or Saturday (9th) at the latest and that I could pick up Sat since I was local. Mark says he will call me Thursday to let me know which day.</li>
<li>Wed, Dec 6 – E-mail sent to Mark on Tue bounces back to me, I call and fax the printed e-mail in.</li>
<li>Thu, Dec 7 – No call from Mark. I cannot reach Reynolds via phone or e-mail.</li>
<li>Fri, Dec 8 – Still cannot reach Reynolds via phone or e-mail. I track down Bill’s cell number via the BarCamp web site to his personal site to his WHOIS record. Bill apologizes, explains that they are having ISP issues (IP phones I guess) and says he’ll find out what is happening and call me back.</li>
<li>Mon, Dec 11 – Call Bill again since he didn’t return my call with information as he said he would. Bill still has no status, says he will call me back.</li>
<li>Tue, Dec 12 – Called Bill twice and left messages. No return call.</li>
<li>Wed, Dec 13 – Call Bill again and leave a message. Since I can’t reach anyone and the drives were supposed to be ready 3 days ago, I drive 45 min to the Reynolds office. No one is there. I finally reach Bill, he tells me to wait that Mark is on his way. 1.5 hours later I give up and leave. Bill calls me on my 45 minute drive home and says he can’t reach Mark.</li>
<li>Thu, Dec 14 – Mark calls in the morning. Note that this is the first time someone from Reynolds has contacted me since Tue, Dec 5 – one week after he was supposed to call. He says that the drives are 55% complete and he will call me in the afternoon. He does not call in the afternoon.</li>
<li>Fri, Dec 15 – No calls from Reynolds, called and left a message with Bill at the end of the day.</li>
<li>Mon, Dec 18 – No calls from Reynolds, called and left a message with Bill at 2pm and at 4:45pm.</li>
<li>Tue, Dec 19 – No calls from Reynolds, called and left a message with Bill at 12pm and at 4:45pm.</li>
<li>(the timeline is continued with updates at the bottom of this post)</li>
</ul>
<p>So now I’m not sure what to do. I can’t seem to get them on the phone, or get them to give me any kind of status information. I can’t even go get the drives back since it appears that no one is at the office<sup><a href="reynolds-data-recovery-nightmare.html#fn1166604180659n" id="fn1166604180659" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I can understand that a phone and e-mail outage means that things are not “business as usual” for Reynolds right now. Maybe if I’d taken the drives to Reynolds first and gotten in and out before their phone and e-mail outage I’d have had a nice smooth experience.</p>
<p>I can try to sympathize and understand, but <strong>at this point I can no longer excuse their failure to communicate or complete the work as promised</strong>. A quick phone call or e-mail when a project is a week and a half past due isn’t too much to ask for.</p>
<p>I decided to blog this in the hopes that it applies some pressure to Reynolds to resolve this quickly (so that they can comment here and show a nice response time). If this doesn’t work, I guess I’ll have to look at other options for recourse.</p>
<p>I hate that they’ve put me in a position to even have to consider this. <em>Please</em>, someone from Reynolds get in touch and fix this.</p>
<p>Based on the information I was given three weeks ago, I decided to postpone my upcoming releases of <a href="http://crowdfavorite.net/tasks-pro/">Tasks Pro™</a> and <a href="http://crowdfavorite.net/tasks/">Tasks</a> to wait until I got my data back rather than re-doing about a week’s worth of work on stuff for the launch. I now regret that choice – I probably won’t be doing those releases until 2007 now.</p>
<ul>
<li>(timeline continued from above)</li>
<li>UPDATE: Wed, Dec 20 – No calls from Reynolds, called and left a message with Bill at 10:45am. Called Bill again at 5pm – he answered but had no information, will try to have someone call me tonight or tomorrow.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Thu, Dec 21 – No calls from Reynolds.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Fri, Dec 22 – No calls from Reynolds.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Tue, Dec 26 – No calls from Reynolds. Reynolds has a new temporary phone number listed on their web site. I dialed it at 9:30am and got an automated voice system. When I pressed 0 to reach an operator (an option given to me), I received a ‘your call cannot be transferred’ error. When I try to type in ‘mark’ in the dial-by-name feature, I also get a ‘your call cannot be transferred’ error. It seems that the original temporary phone number posted on their web site (which would go to voice mail) has been replaced by another temporary phone number that doesn’t work at all. I am close to giving up on them entirely.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Wed, Dec 27 – No calls from Reynolds. Calls to their (new temporary) number still do not work. I was contacted by another local company that does data recovery (see <a href="reynolds-data-recovery-nightmare.html#comment-53680">comment</a> below) and they were kind enough to try to contact folks they knew at Reynolds for me. Unfortunately, they had no luck either.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Thu, Dec 28 – No calls from Reynolds. Tried to call again at 2pm, the phone system is still broken (can’t even leave a message). Called and left a message on Bill’s cell phone around 3pm.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Fri, Dec 29 – No calls from Reynolds. Tried to call again at 10:25am; no luck, no way to leave a message.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Tue, Jan 2 – No calls from Reynolds. New year, same results. Tried to call at noon; no luck, no way to leave a message.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Wed, Jan 3 – No calls from Reynolds. Tried to call at 11:30am; no luck, no way to leave a message. Left another message with Bill’s cell phone. It is now my guess that Reynolds is likely going out of business.</li>
<li>UPDATE: Thu, Jan 4 – No calls from Reynolds. Tried to call at 12:45pm; no luck, no way to leave a message. Left another message with Bill’s cell phone. Drove up to Reynolds and was able to take my drives back. You can <a href="../../../2007/01/08/reynolds-data-recovery-experience.html">read more about that here</a>.</li>

				<p>Alex, do you know that if the phones are down thats the point of doing work? Can’t call acustomer to tell him it’s finished or to get new work, so just let it sit and wait, and of course don’t have someone there to see when the phones come back online. <img src="../../../../wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"> Best of luck with it!</p>

				<p>That level of support is unacceptable, no matter how bad the IT crises are.  When my corporation suffered a roof leak last week that happened to fall right over the IT server room [!], we overcame, despite not having network access for five or six days afterwards.</p>
<p>At some point, you can get back to all the calls.</p>
<p>Hope they’re putting out their fires, though.  That’s really got to suck for a small company.</p>

				<p>I don’t think you should have too much sympathy. Okay, problems with an ISP suck and can take a long time to fix. But everyone has cell phones and internet access at home. How hard would it be to just shoot an e-mail to the customers you are completing a project for from a gmail account letting them know what’s happening and giving them alternate phone number(s). That’s the absolute least.</p>
<p>As an independent consultant I pride myself on my degree of customer service because I know larger organizations can’t compete with it. In this case it’s not even going above-and-beyond, it’s just the bare minimum: communication 101.</p>
<p>The best to you Alex. I hope you find a solution soon…but you have to admit it’s ironically funny in a dark-humor kind-of-way that all this happened because you wanted to use some multimedia keys on a freaking keyboard…!</p>

				<p>Alex, you are getting screwed over by a lame company who knows that they can do whatever they want to you because: (1) they have your drives and important data, and (2) you are being too nice. Recently my largest client ran into similar problems. We finally realized that nice was not working and we had a lawyer jump into the mix via a phone call and sending a certified letter. Within 72hrs, the problem was fixed. I recommend you do the same. I am sure a lawyer can dream up some serious damages that this firm has done to you and will let them know exactly how much they will suffer if they do not meet their obligations under their and your “verbal contract.”</p>
<p>Just my two cents. Seems like phone and e-mail is a dead end for you just based on your post.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

				<p>I agree with Rob G. Adding some legitimate pressure might help in this situation. Either by a lawyer or perhaps a little physical threat. Just casually mention in your next voicemail you ‘know how to make a Molotov cocktail and aren’t afraid to use it’ or perhaps say ‘Bill, I know where you live, if you want a peaceful Christmas just get my freaking data recovered’  😉</p>

				<p>You possess super-human patience. This is the point when I calmly tell the company that I want satisfaction now or I’ll send my wife in. And no one wants that. (She once got us a free lawn mower, which I think was Lowe’s attempt to get her to go away!) 😉</p>

				<p>Update 2/20/07  Their website is back up today and the phone is ringing (no longer disconnected, but still no answer).  I had lost hope for my drive and $895 credit card charge from 10/18/07, but this is an improvement.  I hope they can re-establish operations and remediate the in-process work, either complete the job or refund and return.<br>

				<p>Same story, different day.</p>
<p>Drives sent to Reynolds in late September.  Charged on my AMEX 10/1/07 and since then no returned calls or emails.  Got Bill’s cell and spoke with him twice. That has gotten me nowhere.</p>
<p>I’m left with reversing charges, contacting paypal and any other bureau I can find if I don’t hear from them by tomorrow.  Then it’s legal time.</p>
<p>All I would need is a call back to give me an update and I’d hold off everything, but that is apparently not happening.</p>

				<p>Seems like you have had quite a situation with this company. If you want to post this experience and have it spread around so that others may know about it you can go to <a href="http://www.datarecoverycomparison.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.datarecov[...]mparison.com</a> and get back at the company that pretty much screwed you over. This site allows for users to create an account and leave a review on pretty much every single data recovery company out there; also if the company is not on the site you can add it by going to contact us and leaving a new company request. This website will help others avoid the nightmare of an experience that you had with your data recovery job. Feel free to visit the site, make an account, and leave a review. Together we can make a difference in the data recovery business, and help data recovery consumers be smart shoppers.</p>
